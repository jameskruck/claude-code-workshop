**Course:** Strategic Pricing for B2B SaaS
**Due:** End of Week 3
**Weight:** 20% of final grade
**Format:** Individual written analysis

---

## Assignment Overview

Analyze Slack's pricing strategy evolution from 2014 to present and recommend whether a mid-market B2B SaaS company should follow a similar path.

---

## Context

You are a pricing strategy consultant hired by **DataFlow**, a B2B project management SaaS company with:
- 50,000 active users
- $15M ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue)
- Currently: Single $10/user/month tier
- Retention: 85% annually
- Free tier: Unlimited users, 30-day message history

The CEO asks: "Should we copy Slack's pricing model? They went from free to $7 to $15 per user. Is that our playbook?"

---

## Required Analysis

Write a **1,500-1,800 word strategic memo** addressing:

### 1. Slack's Pricing Evolution (400-500 words)
- **2014-2016:** Free tier strategy - what did they give away and why?
- **2017:** Introduction of paid tiers at $6.67-$12.50/user/month - what was the value metric?
- **2020:** Price increase to $8-$15/user/month - how did they justify it?
- **Present:** Enterprise Grid pricing - why did they add a third tier?

**Key question:** What strategic logic drove each transition? (Don't just describe - analyze WHY)

### 2. Willingness to Pay Analysis (400-500 words)
- What signals did Slack use to determine pricing levels?
- How did their pricing compare to competitors (Microsoft Teams, Google Chat)?
- What customer segments were they targeting at each tier?
- How did COVID-19 remote work surge affect their pricing power?

**Key question:** Could they have charged more earlier, or would that have killed growth?

### 3. Recommendation for DataFlow (500-600 words)
Should DataFlow follow Slack's playbook? Your analysis must include:
- **Similarities:** Where does DataFlow's situation match Slack's?
- **Differences:** Where does it diverge? (market position, competitive landscape, customer segments)
- **Pricing recommendation:** Specific tier structure with $ amounts and feature differentiation
- **Migration strategy:** How to move existing customers from $10 single tier to new structure
- **Risk assessment:** What could go wrong? (customer churn, revenue loss, competitive response)

**Key question:** If you recommend against copying Slack, what alternative approach do you suggest?

### 4. Price Experimentation Plan (200 words)
How would you TEST your pricing recommendation before full rollout?
- What would you experiment with?
- What metrics would you track?
- What's your success threshold?

## Deliverables

Submit a **PDF memo** with:
1. Executive summary (150 words max)
2. Analysis sections 1-4 as outlined above
3. Appendix: Pricing comparison table (Slack vs. DataFlow vs. 2 competitors)

**Formatting:** 12pt font, 1.5 line spacing, professional business memo style

## Resources Provided

- **Interview:** VP of Pricing at a Series B SaaS company (video, 22 minutes)
- **Articles:** SaaS pricing benchmarks from OpenView Partners

## Evaluation Criteria

Your analysis will be assessed on:
- **Strategic thinking:** Do you identify the key factors driving pricing decisions?
- **Analytical rigor:** Do you use data and frameworks to support recommendations?
- **Practical application:** Is your DataFlow recommendation realistic and actionable?
- **Business writing:** Is the memo clear, concise, and executive-ready?

**Note:** There is no single "right answer" - you will be evaluated on quality of reasoning, not whether you recommend following Slack's model or diverging from it.
