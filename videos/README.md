## Placeholder Integration

The HTML currently shows video placeholders with:
- Play button (â–¶)
- Video title
- Duration badge
- Description

These will be replaced with actual embedded videos when available.

## Hosting Options

Consider these platforms for video hosting:
1. **YouTube** (unlisted videos) - Free, reliable
2. **Vimeo** - Professional, customizable player
3. **Direct hosting** - Host MP4 files directly (larger bandwidth usage)

## Implementation Notes

When videos are ready:
1. Replace video-placeholder divs with actual video embeds
2. Maintain same styling and responsive behavior
3. Keep fallback text for accessibility
4. Test on mobile devices
