## üö® Current Issue Being Debugged

**Problem:** User reports seeing "Activity 2" content underneath the "Next: Pre-Workshop Setup" button in the Overview section.

**Investigation Status:**
- HTML structure is correct (verified section boundaries)
- Added debug CSS with visual indicators to identify the issue
- Suspect CSS display/positioning problem or JavaScript navigation failure

**Debug Features Added:**
- Gold border around active sections
- Section ID labels in top-right corners
- Enhanced console logging in JavaScript

**Next Steps for Resolution:**
1. User needs to check what debug indicators show
2. Identify if multiple sections are displaying or if content is visually displaced
3. Apply appropriate fix based on findings

## üîß Technical Architecture Notes

### Workshop Navigation System:
- Sections controlled by `.workshop-section` class with `display: none/block`
- Active section has `.workshop-section.active` class
- JavaScript functions: `initializeNavigation()`, `navigateToSection()`, `ensureSingleActiveSection()`
- URL updates with history.replaceState()

### Key Files Structure:
```
claude-code-workshop/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html (main workshop interface)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css (all styling including navigation buttons)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ script.js (navigation and interactive functionality)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server.js (AI chat backend)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Starter Pack/ (educational resources for participants)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SESSION_LOG.md (this file)
```

## üí° Key Learning Points

1. **Content Duplication:** Major issue in educational interfaces - systematic review prevents user confusion
2. **Section Navigation:** Complex single-page applications need robust state management
3. **Repository Management:** Always verify remote URLs when syncing/cloning
4. **Educational Tool Design:** Real examples more compelling than placeholders
5. **Debug Strategies:** Visual indicators crucial for diagnosing layout issues
